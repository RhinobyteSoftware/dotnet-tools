## Cause

You want to order your enum member names alphabetically to make it easier to find a specific member and you're ok with the potentially
breaking change.

## Rule description

Order enum members alphabetically

```csharp
public enum ExampleEnum
{
    Alpha,
    Bravo,
    Charlie,
    Golf,
    Zulu
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, re-order the enum members alphabetically.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress these warnings when there are legitimate reasons to deviate from the agreed upon ordering.
