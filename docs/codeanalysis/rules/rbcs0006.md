## Cause

You want to order your record type member names alphabetically to make it easier to find a specific member and you're ok with the potentially
breaking change.

## Rule description

Order record type members alphabetically

```csharp
public record ExampleRecord(string Alpha, string Bravo, string Charlie);

public record ExampleRecord2
{
    public string Alpha { get; init; }
    public string Bravo { get; init; }
    public string Charlie { get; init; }
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, re-order the record type members alphabetically.

## When to suppress warnings
