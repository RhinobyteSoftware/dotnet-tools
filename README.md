## Libraries/Projects



## Contributing

Filing issues for problems encountered is greatly appreciated and contribution via PRs is welcomed.

Code changes that modify a library's public API signature will require a new major version number. For any such changes, please create an issue for discussion first and include the label `api-suggestion`. Please do not submit pull requests that include style changes.

Maintaining a very high percentage of test coverage over these libraries will be an important requirement when reviewing pull requests. The `devops/create-code-coverage-report` shell script can be run to execute the tests with code coverage enabled and to generate an html version of the coverage results report. When making a code contribution please ensure you update all existing tests as necessary and add new test cases to cover new code.
